Since .Mac hosting was removed, jamesorriv.com has been wallowing in oblivion.

Until now.

I came across [Jekyll][jekyll] on [Alvaro's site][alvarop] and saw free hosting on [Github][gh] so I am resurrecting the site in order to play with the tech.
No idea if this is going to be a regular thing or just one of my explorations until I am bored. Will find out as time goes on.

Ciao
