Attended my first [autocross](http://www.pca-ggr.org/autocross/) event put on by Golden Gate Region Porsche Club of America (GGR-PCA).

Here is the video of my 6 runs:

| Times(s) | Notes
|-----------|------
| 65.926 | DNF
| 61.359 |
| 59.520 |
| 59.467 |
| 59.413 | Personal Best
| 60.382 |

Ended up in the 3rd group, which meant I worked the course for the first group. This was a boon because I got to watch other people run the course.

First run I had an instructor and missed the course in a couple of places. But it was a good to get a feel for the course and gave me something to start from. Was really pumped to have beaten 60s by the last run of the morning. I actually ran faster than one of the guys with a 911 in my work group. On my last run of the day I attempted to downshift on the horseshoe which was a huge mistake. Live and learn.

Best line from instructor in the video: "You are missing everything!!"

Guys with 911s and Cayman GTSs were posting in the 55s range. Really fast guys were just under 50s.

The 911 GT3 is a BEAST!! And in particular the 911 GT3 RS on race slicks. That guy set the best time.
