I wanted to make a *new* post and found out the site was not working. After fiddling with GoDaddy
DNS and pouring over github pages documentation for 5 minutes, I have the site back up. Not sure
who is too blame but it doesn't look like anybody cares so no harm no foul.

Now that it is up, I might actually add some content.
